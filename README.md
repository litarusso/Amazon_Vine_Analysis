## Summary
Upon checking these figures, there is a significant difference between the paid and unpaid reviews. 
From the 170 paid reviews only 65 turn out to be 5 stars, which brings us to a 38.24%

Then we have 37840 unpaid reviews, a highly elevated amount compared to the paid ones.
Here, 20612 unpaid reviews which make the 54.47% are 5 Star reviews.

Therefore, this gap between the 5 star reviews percentages in favor of unpaid ones shows a positive bias in the Amazon Vine Program.
